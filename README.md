# Learn Kurdish

## Kurdish Language
Kurdish is an Indo-European language spoken by the Kurdish people in the Middle East. It has several dialects, with Kurmanji and Sorani being the most widely spoken. Kurdish is primarily written in the Latin script in Turkey and Syria, while Sorani uses a modified Arabic script in Iraq and Iran.

## Dialect Focus
Our focus will be on the Sorani dialect, which is spoken in parts of Iraq and Iran. Sorani is known for its rich literary tradition and is one of the two official languages of Iraq.
Sorani Kurdish is characterized by its use of the Arabic script, which has been adapted to accommodate Kurdish phonetics.
Also, Sorani has many sub-dialects, for example, the Erbil and Sulaymaniyah dialects, which can differ in pronunciation and vocabulary. For example, the word for "why" is "لۆ" (Lo) in Erbil and "بۆ" (Bo) in Sulaymaniyah.
We will be learning the Hawleri (Erbil) dialect, with the mention of standard equivalents where necessary.

## Basic Phrases
### Greetings
Since majority of Kurdish speakers are Muslims, greetings often include religious phrases. Main one is "سلام علیکم" (Salaam Alaikum), which means "Peace be upon you." The response is "وعلیکم السلام" (Wa Alaikum Salaam), meaning "And upon you be peace."
However, there are also a more formal greeting "سڵاو" (Slaw), which means "Hello." The response is also "سڵاو" (Slaw), however, that is really something you would say when greeting someone online or in a text message. If you meet someone in person, you would use "سلام علیکم" (Salaam Alaikum) instead.

### Other Greetings
The following are some very rarely used greetings, but they are still good to know:
